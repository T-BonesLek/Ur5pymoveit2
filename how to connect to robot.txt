#Get calibration
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash

ros2 launch ur_calibration calibration_correction.launch.py \
robot_ip:=192.168.0.102 target_filename:=my_robot_calibration.yaml


Thoroughly follow the procedure as explained:
PROFINET should be disabled. I have explained how to disable it.
Configure UR IP as 192.168.0.102 and netmask 255.255.255.0 and Host-PC IP 192.168.0.107 and netmask 255.255.255.0 
Configure URCap External Control Important point is to set the IP address 192.168.0.107 and port 50002 while configuring URCap external control.


Setup on pc:
connected to router which is connected to robot and other devices that should talk over ros2
-set static ip on host computer on the wired settings:
    address 192.168.0.107
    net mask 255.255.255.0

Setup on robot:
-Network in settings
    -Static address
    - ip : 192.168.0.102 (192.16.0.XXX) is the important. xxx is variable as you want
    -sub net mask must be same as host: 255.255.255.0
    -the rest should be zeros

-External control in program
    -Host ip: the ip of the host computer 192.168.0.107
    -custom port : 50002
